The US National Institute of Standards and Technology created it, although, there is nothing US specific about it. Here it is, cloud computing is a way of using I.T. that has these five equally important traits.

*1. First, you get computing resources on-demand and self-service. All you have to do is use a simple interface and you get the processing power, storage, and network you need, with no need for human intervention.*
*2. Second, you access these resources over the net from anywhere you want.*
*3. Third, the provider of those resources has a big pool of them and allocates them to customers out of that pool. That allows the provider to get economies of scale by buying in bulk and pass the savings on to the customers. Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources.*
*4. Fourth, the resources are elastic. If you need more resources you can get more, rapidly. If you need less, you can scale back.*
*5. Last, the customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go. If they stop using resources, they stop paying.*


## OPEN SOURCE

**Cloud Dataproc** offers the open source big data environment Hadoop, as a managed service.
**TensorFlow:** Machine learning open source software library developed inside Google, is at the heart of a strong open source ecosystem.
**Kubernetes:** gives customers the ability to mix and match microservices running across different clouds
**Google Stackdriver:** lets customers monitor workload across multiple cloud providers.


## FACTS

### According to public stimations
```
Google's network carries as much as 40% of the world's Internet traffic every day.
100,000 km of fiber cable and 8 subsea cables
```

### Renewable Energy
```
- Google is one of the world's largest corporate purchasers of wind and solar energy.
- Google has been a hundred percent carbon neutral since 2007.
- Tts data centers energy source will shortly reach a hundred percent renewable energy.
```

### Payments and reliability
```
Google was the first major Cloud provider to deliver per second billing for its IaaS Compute offering.
```
```
Google gives customers the ability to run their applications elsewhere, 
if Google becomes no longer the best provider for their needs
```

## CLOUD SECURITY
Google services that want to make themselves available on the Internet register themselves with an infrastructure service called the **Google Front End**, which ```checks incoming network connections for correct certificates and best practices.```
The GFE also additionally, applies protections against denial of service attacks. ```The sheer scale of its infrastructure, enables Google to simply absorb many denial of service attacks, even behind the GFEs.```
Google also has **multi-tier, multi-layer denial of service protections** that further reduce the risk of any denial of service impact.
Inside Google's infrastructure, **machine intelligence and rules warn of possible incidents**.
Google conducts **Red Team exercises**, ```simulated attacks to improve the effectiveness of its responses.```
Google aggressively **limits and actively monitors the activities of employees** who have been granted administrative access to the infrastructure.
To **guard against phishing attacks** against Google employees, employee accounts including mine require use of **U2F compatible security keys**.
To help ensure that code is as secure as possible Google stores its **source code centrally** and requires **two-party review of new code**.
Google also ```gives its developers libraries that keep them from introducing certain classes of security bugs.```
Externally, Google also runs a **vulnerability rewards program**, where we ```pay anyone who is able to discover and inform us of bugs in our infrastructure or applications.```
